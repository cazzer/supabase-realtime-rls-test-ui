# Supabase RLS Exploration

There are two things going on here:

1. Supabase stack
2. Simple web app for testing the database

## Running Everything Locally

### Docker

All the batteries are included except for Docker, you've gotta do that part yourself. [Here's a link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if need one.

### .env.local

Snag a copy of the example environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Install deps

```
yarn
```

### Run it locally

```
yarn start-local
```
